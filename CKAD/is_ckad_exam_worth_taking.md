# Is the Linux Foundation CKAD exam worth taking?
If you're thinking about taking the CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) exam but have some questions/concerns, I hope the following advice helps!
_________________
**TL;DR**
Take the CKAD exam if you want to learn Kubernetes:
- but need something official to force you to study
- need to show progress to a manager for promotion
- want an official resumé boost

Don't bother with the CKAD exam if you want to learn Kubernetes:
- and are able to learn more on your own accord without structure
- do not enjoy memorizing impractical things for the sake of an exam
- do not perform well in a time-pressured exam setting
- do not want to spend money on a certification
_________________
### Benefits
- **You will learn a lot in the process**
  - Having an exam you're working towards will help keep you focused and on task, ensuring you are learning some important features of Kubernetes.
- **Add an official certification to your resumé**
  - Recruiters and Hiring Managers often notice if you are putting in extra effort to learn new concepts, and official certifications help validate your efforts and learnings.
- **Show initiative/progress at your current job**
  - Similar to the effect with external observers, your current Manager and coworkers will likely notice you going the extra mile.

### Downsides
- **You might learn more on your own**
  - If you are self-motivated, you can likely learn additional or more practical concepts by working on your own project or studying your own curriculum rather than studying solely to pass the exam. A couple concepts where the exam materials fall short is exclusively using kubectl to create Resources and mocking the deployment of Kubernetes clusters. To use Kubernetes in practice, you will likely host clusters via Cloud Infrastructure such as GCP or AWS and you will likely make changes to these clusters either via UIs or using an Infrastructure as code (IaC) tool such as [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/use-cases/manage-kubernetes than using a CLI).
- **Time/Exam pressure**
  - If you do not perform well in timed exam settings (totally understandable), you may want to not waste your time with CKAD. The exam is 2 hours long and you will almost certainly not have enough time to finish every task and check your work for correctness.
- **Only lasts 3 years**
  - If you succeed in passing the CKAD exam, the certification only lasts 3 years at which point you will need to take the exam again if you want to keep your certification up-to-date
- **Relatively expensive**
  - The CKAD exam is a couple hundred dollars just to attempt, so depending on its value to you, it might not make sense financially (though there are often discounts offered around holidays).
